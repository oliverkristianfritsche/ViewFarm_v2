{
  "botid": "your_bot_id",
  "YOUTUBE_API_KEY": "your_youtube_api_key",
  "youtubescrapper": {
    "searchBy": "hashtag",
    "searchValue": "your_search_value",
    "maxResults": 50,
    "order": "viewCount",
    "shorts_category_id": "0",
    "max_short_length": 60
  },
  "CLIENT_ID": "your_client_id",
  "CLIENT_SECRET": "your_client_secret",
  "USER_AGENT": "your_user_agent",
